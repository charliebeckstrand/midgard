/**
 * Resolves a plot frame's drawing size from its {@link FrameSizing} policy,

 * the frame only when it must. An explicit `width` is returned as-is with no
 * measurement — the deterministic path for fixed frames, SSR output, and
 * tests — otherwise the container's width is measured and the frame fills
 * it. The container's height is measured only under a `fill` policy; `fixed`,
 * `aspect`, and `content` heights ignore it, so tracking it would re-render
 * the frame on every resize for a value the policy discards. A frame whose
 * size is fully fixed by props observes nothing at all, so a resize never
 * reaches it.
 *
 * Resize notifications commit as transitions: the frame tracks its container
 * live — no settle window, no timers — while React coalesces a burst by
 * abandoning renders whose size is already stale, so a window drag on a slow
 * frame refits at the pace the machine can afford and always lands on the
 * final size. The first measurement commits synchronously, so a frame
 * revealed after mount paints at once.
 *
 * @param width - An explicit drawing width, or `undefined` to fill and
 * measure the container.
 * @param sizing - The frame's sizing policy, from `chartFrameSizing` or
 * `mapFrameSizing`.
 * @returns The wrapper `ref` to attach and the resolved drawing box — an
 * unmeasured `width` stays `0`, which renders the frame shell without marks
 * for that first paint (server and client agree, so no hydration mismatch).
