# Correctness & Cleanliness Audit — the `ui` component surface

**Date:** 2026-07-16 · **Scope:** every public `ui` component, swept in
alphabetical batches of ten. **Lens:** correctness (behavioral bugs, a11y,
state, edge cases) and cleanliness (pattern concision, dead/duplicated code,
optimization). Deliberate architecture — the controlled/uncontrolled triads,
the form-binding cascade, recipe variants, static-tier explicit sizing and DOM
projections, `data-slot` anchors, §3.6 per-item render callbacks — is screened
out before flagging, exactly as the [props audit](2026-07-13-PROPS-AUDIT.md)
did. **Method:** direct source reads of each component's every file plus the
core/recipe/hook machinery it composes; each claim re-verified against source,
tests, and grep before it lands. **Living record — resolve rows in place with
the commit.**

Verdicts: **FIX** (correctness defect) · **SIMPLIFY** (dead/duplicated/verbose
code, concision) · **OPTIMIZE** (measurable waste) · **DOC** (stale or wrong
doccomment) · **WATCH** (recorded so the next sweep doesn't relitigate).

## Batch 1 — accordion · address-input · alert · aspect-ratio · avatar · badge · banner · box · breadcrumb · button

### Executive summary

No correctness defects. The batch is behaviorally sound: Alert's
controlled-without-handler dismissal, its polite-severity re-announcement (which
correctly stays silent for an alert already open on mount — pinned by
`alert.test.tsx:142`), Avatar's image-vs-initials accessible-name resolution,
Button's icon-only-vs-labeled sizing and loading-anchor gating, and
address-input's abort-on-change fetch lifecycle each hold up under trace. What
the sweep found is one un-migrated skeleton duplicate (with a stale factory
doc pointing at it), plus a thin sediment of dead-in-one-mode branches and one
re-export layer that half its own consumer already bypasses.

### Findings

| # | Verb | Surface | Site | Issue | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | SIMPLIFY + DOC | AvatarSkeleton | avatar-skeleton.tsx:12 · placeholder-skeleton.ts:72 | Hand-rolls exactly what `createSkeleton(k.skeleton, …)` emits — `<Placeholder className={cn(k.skeleton.base, k.skeleton.size[size ?? 'md'], className)}>`. `k.skeleton` is `kokkaku.avatar` (`{ base, size: shaku.avatar }`) and `AvatarVariants['size']` is keyed to that same `shaku.avatar` scale, so `sizeClassFor` resolves identically to the direct index — the factory output is byte-for-byte the same. The factory's own doc names Avatar the reason to write inline ("Components that wrap the placeholder (Avatar's `DensityScope`)…"), but `DensityScope` lives only in `input-frame.tsx`; Avatar has no wrap. The exception is stale and the leaf is an un-migrated duplicate. | `AvatarSkeleton = createSkeleton(k.skeleton, 'AvatarSkeleton')` + `AvatarSkeletonProps = SkeletonProps<NonNullable<AvatarVariants['size']>>` (badge-skeleton verbatim); add `} as const` to `kokkaku/avatar.ts` for inference parity with button/badge; repoint the factory doc at a real inline case (Control's join-aware skeleton). | ✅ RESOLVED (folded into `createSkeleton`; factory doc repointed; `kokkaku/avatar` aligned with `as const`) |
| 2 | SIMPLIFY | Box | box.tsx:4-18,104-111 · box/variants.ts:9-15 | `variants.ts` re-exports `k.padding`→`paddingMap`, `k.px`→`pxMap`, … as pass-through aliases, and `box.tsx` imports the seven maps from it — yet reaches `k.bg`/`k.outline` **directly** from the kata in the same `cn()` call. The indirection layer isn't a consistent boundary; it's bypassed for two of nine axes. | Drop the map aliases; index `k.padding[p]` etc. directly (as bg/outline already do). Keep the exported `Box*` types in `variants.ts`. | ◯ OPEN |
| 3 | SIMPLIFY | address-input | use-address-input-suggestions.ts:64 | `const delay = query.length === 0 ? 0 : debounceMs` — the `=== 0` arm is unreachable under the default `minQueryLength` (3): the effect returns early at `query.length < minQueryLength`, so length 0 only survives when `minQueryLength ≤ 0`. For every default consumer `delay` is just `debounceMs`. | Collapse to `debounceMs`, or document the `minQueryLength: 0` zero-debounce intent if deliberate. | ◯ OPEN |
| 4 | SIMPLIFY | Accordion | use-accordion-selection.ts:68 | `const collapsible = isMultiple ? true : (props.collapsible ?? true)` — the `isMultiple ? true` arm is dead: multiple-mode `toggle` adds/removes unconditionally and never reads `collapsible`. | Compute only for the single branch (or inline `props.collapsible ?? true` where the single-mode toggle reads it). | ◯ OPEN |

### Watch-list

| Surface | Note | Status |
|---|---|---|
| useAccordionSelection | Wraps `props.onValueChange` in its own ref **and** memoizes `onControllableChange` (`useCallback([isMultiple])`) — but `useControllable` already reads its `onValueChange` off a ref behind a stable `setValue`, so an unstable inline callback would be handled. The ref+memo pair is belt-and-suspenders, not a correctness requirement; harmless, recorded so it isn't re-derived. | ◯ OPEN |
| Leaf `data-slot` override policy | Static leaves split on whether a consumer can clobber the slot name: box/alert destructure `'data-slot'` with a default (stable identity); aspect-ratio/badge/banner spread `{...props}` last (overridable). No bug — the overridable ones aren't typed to accept `data-slot` from most call sites — but the split is worth one policy note. | ◯ OPEN |
| Banner `position` · Box `m`/`mx`/`my` | Already filed by the [props audit](2026-07-13-PROPS-AUDIT.md) (`position` REMOVE; margins REMOVE). Not re-litigated here. | ↗ props audit |

### Audited clean (no findings)

accordion (root/item/trigger/panel/context), alert, aspect-ratio, avatar (root
+ group), badge, banner, breadcrumb (all six parts), button (root, headless,
constants, utilities, skeleton), address-input (photon provider + suggestions
hook). The shared machinery these compose — `createSlot`, `createContext`,
`createSkeleton`, `useControllable`, `useA11yDisclosure`, `useA11yRoving` — was
read to verify the claims above and is sound.

## Batch 2 — calendar · card · checkbox · code · collapse · color · combobox · command-palette · confirm · container

### Executive summary

Two real correctness bugs, one per-keystroke re-render hole, and one
cross-cutting empty-state gap — all clustered where a popover or a virtualized
list meets focus/highlight state; the leaves (card, checkbox, code, collapse,
confirm, container) and the large date subsystem are otherwise clean. Calendar
is exceptionally sound: the day-grid roving under a constant CSS column offset,
the sub-100-year date math routed through `@internationalized/date`, and the
render-phase re-anchor all hold up. The bugs: a virtualized command-palette
resumed keyboard navigation from the prior session's highlight index on reopen;
the popover color picker's hex/RGB inputs couldn't be focused by click; two
black colours differing only in saturation compared unequal; and the combobox's
`setQuery` reintroduced the per-keystroke option re-render its own `queryRef`
machinery exists to prevent. All four are fixed. The remaining one — shared
`VirtualOptions` keeping the listbox non-`:empty`, so the "No results" CSS state
never fires under virtualization (both Combobox and CommandPalette) — is recorded
for a shared-primitive decision rather than fixed autonomously.

### Findings

| # | Verb | Surface | Site | Issue | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | FIX (high) | command-palette | use-command-palette-state.ts:60,108 | `activeIndexRef` is reset nowhere on close, so a virtualized palette reopens at the prior session's index: the close branch clears only the query, the seed effect early-returns on the unchanged empty `deferredQuery`, and the dialog unmounts its options (no DOM `data-active` to read the index back off). The first arrow then lands at `index+1`, not the first item — contra the seed doc. Combobox clears it via `clearVirtualActiveIndexed` on `!open`; the palette had no equivalent. | Reset `activeIndexRef.current = -1` in the render-phase close branch; the dialog's `PresencePortal` unmounts the options, so no DOM clear is needed. | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 2 | FIX (high) | ColorPicker (popover) | color-picker-content.tsx:71 · color-hex-input.tsx · color-channel-inputs.tsx | The content wrapper's `onMouseDown={preventDefault}` (which holds focus for the area/slider drag model that self-focuses via `useColorDrag`) suppresses the native mousedown→focus for the hex and RGB(A) text inputs, so they can't be edited by mouse. DatePicker documents and guards the identical hazard per field (`date-picker-relative.tsx:152`, `stopPropagation`); the color inputs lacked it. Inline `ColorPanel` is unaffected (no wrapper). | `onMouseDown` stopPropagation on the hex and channel `<Input>`s (lands on the `<input>` via `…rest`; a no-op inline; mirrors DatePicker). | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 3 | FIX (med) | equalHsva | color-utilities.ts:44 | Two colours that render identically as black (`v=0`) but differ in saturation compared unequal, contradicting the doccomment ("render identically"): `hueMoot` collapses hue at `v=0`/`s=0` but the return still required `s` equality, so the `#000000` swatch never showed active once the area was dragged to the bottom at `s>0`. | Add `satMoot` (`v=0`) mirroring `hueMoot`; a new synchronous `equalHsva` case pins it. | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 4 | OPTIMIZE (med) | combobox | use-combobox-state.ts:66 | `setQuery`'s `[onQueryChange]` dependency reintroduces exactly the churn the file's `queryRef`/`deferredQueryRef` exist to prevent: an inline `onQueryChange` (a realistic consumer pattern) gives `setQuery` — and through it `close`, `select`, and the combobox context — a new identity every render, re-rendering every `ComboboxOption` on the typing path the deferred query keeps cheap (the memoized option can't bail; its `onSelect` changes). The `open` path avoids this because `useControllable` refs its callback. | Read `onQueryChange` through a ref (the `useControllable` pattern); `setQuery` becomes empty-dep and stable. | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 5 | FIX (med, cross-cutting) | VirtualOptions | virtual-options.tsx:170 · combobox-panel.tsx · command-palette.tsx:166 | `VirtualOptions` always renders its `containerRef` wrapper `<div role="presentation">` inside the listbox — needed for scroll measurement even at zero items — so the listbox is never `:empty` and the `peer-empty` "No results" state can't fire under virtualization; a virtualized Combobox/CommandPalette filtered to zero shows a blank panel with no message. Reachable via the `VirtualizedPeople` demo. | Shared decision: signal emptiness from the primitive (or move the empty-state off CSS `:empty`) without dropping `containerRef` (a naive `return null` loses scroll measurement). Both consumers share the pattern. Recorded, not fixed. | ◯ OPEN |

### Minor / watch-list

| Surface | Site | Note | Verb | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| combobox | use-combobox-input.ts:51,57 | Dead `selectionStart/End === null` guard + stale "a selectionless input type" comment after the `inputType` removal (#993): the input is always `type="text"`, so the selection is never null. | SIMPLIFY + DOC | ◯ OPEN |
| combobox | use-combobox-state.ts:134 | `select` re-tests `shouldClose` in two separate `if` blocks; one `if/else` evaluates it once and reads cleaner. | SIMPLIFY | ◯ OPEN |
| combobox | use-combobox-state.ts:101 | A purely external controlled `open={false}` routes through `setOpen` only, leaving `editing`/`query` unreset — the input shows stale query text until retype. Every in-component close path already reaches `close()`. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| color | color-utilities.ts:94 | `((G - B) / d) % 6` — the `% 6` is a dead no-op (`(G-B)/d ∈ [-1,1]`; the later `if (h < 0) h += 360` handles the wrap). Mirrors the textbook formula. | SIMPLIFY | ◯ OPEN |
| color | color-swatches.tsx:20 | `hexToHsva(swatch)` re-parses ~20 preset hexes on every panel render (each drag frame included); a `useMemo` over `swatches` hoists it. Micro. | OPTIMIZE | ◯ OPEN |
| color | color-eyedropper.tsx:63 | `disabled={disabled}` on the Button is dead: `ColorEyedropper` renders only under `!disabled` (color-panel.tsx:102). | SIMPLIFY | ◯ OPEN |
| color | color-area.tsx:39,75 · color-slider.tsx:44,75 | Keyboard nudges derive the changed channel from the render snapshot, not the `setHsva` `prev`, so fast key-repeat before a commit can coalesce a step. Drag path (absolute) is immune. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| calendar | calendar-utilities.ts:114 | `getMonthLabels` uses raw `new Date(2021, i, 1)` — the lone bypass of the file's `CalendarDate` convention (year hardcoded safe, so cosmetic). | SIMPLIFY | ◯ OPEN |
| calendar | use-calendar-picker.tsx:141 | `dispatch({ type: 'open', year })` duplicates the open effect's dispatch, but seeds the reducer pre-paint in the same click tick (a defensible stale-year guard). | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| command-palette | command-palette.tsx:72 · use-command-palette-state.ts:32 | Docs cite type-ahead reaching windowed items, but the palette never enables roving `typeahead` — arrow-only. | DOC | ◯ OPEN |
| command-palette | command-palette.tsx:166 | The "No results" `<output>` carries constant text toggled purely by CSS; announcement of a `display` toggle of unchanged text varies by screen reader (verify against a real SR). | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| code | code-block.tsx:65 | The doc calls the cache "LRU" but eviction is FIFO (no recency bump on hit); immaterial for stable snippets. | DOC | ◯ OPEN |

### Audited clean (no findings)

card (frame + five slots), checkbox (root/field/group), code + code-block,
collapse (root/trigger/panel/context), confirm, container. Calendar's fourteen
files — day-grid roving under CSS offset, month/year date math, range-edge
rounding, the picker reducer, and the a11y wiring — were traced and verified
sound, as were the color drag/state hooks (`useColorDrag` pointer-capture
lifecycle, `useColorState` reconcile) and the combobox open/close/highlight/
selection machine and command-palette non-virtual path beyond the rows above.

## Batch 3 — context-menu · control · copy-button · credit-card-input · currency-input · date-input · date-picker · dialog · divider · dl

### Executive summary

Two real bugs, both again at the seam where a formatted input meets shared
popover/caret machinery: the relative date-picker's custom mode had its
Start/End fields' arrow keys stolen by the dialog's virtual-model focus
reclaim, and the currency input turned a typed leading decimal (`.5`) into `5.`
— ten times the intended value — because it lacked the type-at-end caret branch
its date-input sibling documents for the identical pad hazard. One reuse
consolidation: `resolveContextMenuEntries` re-implemented the exported
`mergeContextMenuItems` primitive inline, leaving the primitive with zero real
consumers. Three doccomment corrections rode along. Batch-2's open lead on
DatePicker keyboard navigation resolved clean: every grid-highlight write is
clamped into `[min, max]`, so arrow keys cannot park the highlight on a
disabled date. Dialog, date-input, control's cascade, and the small leaves
(copy-button, divider, dl) audited clean.

### Findings

| # | Verb | Surface | Site | Issue | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | FIX (med-high) | DatePicker (relative custom) | date-picker-content.tsx:166 · use-date-picker-relative-state.ts:358 | The dialog keydown's `NAVIGATION_KEYS` focus-reclaim (`event.currentTarget.focus()`) runs for every content variant, but its rationale — a grid move can unmount the focused day button — applies only to the calendar variants. Custom mode passes `onKeyDown = undefined` and renders editable Start/End `<DatePicker input>` fields whose keydowns bubble unimpeded, so pressing ArrowLeft/Right to move the text caret yanked focus to the dialog container; caret arrows were unusable and the nested-picker roving broke after the first key. Untested path (custom-mode tests only type digits and click). | Gate the reclaim on `onKeyDown &&`: no virtual model, no reclaim — the presence-implies-control convention (props audit T5) already distinguishes the modes. | ✅ RESOLVED (early-return form; contract added to the prop TSDoc) |
| 2 | FIX (med-high) | CurrencyInput | currency-input.tsx:107 · currency-input-utilities.ts:56 | `onChange` always routed through `reformat`'s meaningful-count caret restore, but `formatEditing` pads a `0` before a bare decimal (`.` → `0.`); the restore counts that pad as the first meaningful char and pins the caret between `0` and `.`, so the next digit lands in the integer part: typing `.5` produced `5.` — `$5.00`, 10× off, wrong side of the decimal. Exactly the pad hazard `date-input.tsx:214-218` defends with its type-at-end branch; currency had no equivalent, and no test typed a leading decimal incrementally. | Mirror DateInput: when the caret is at the end, format without queuing the caret restore. New test pins `.5` → `0.5`. | ✅ RESOLVED (shared local `format` keeps the branch and the hook formatter from drifting) |
| 3 | SIMPLIFY | context-menu | context-menu-merge.ts:42-48 | `resolveContextMenuEntries` re-implemented `mergeContextMenuItems` inline — the same empty-group filtering and separator join, via two early returns plus a `GROUP_SEPARATOR` constant — while the exported primitive, billed by its own doc as "the building block a host uses," had zero non-test consumers repo-wide. | Route the resolver through `mergeContextMenuItems([a, b])`; delete the constant and early returns. Behavior-identical (tests assert separator shape and item identity, not the separator key). | ✅ RESOLVED (single-call form: the ternary picks the group order, the merge stays invariant) |
| 4 | DOC | Control | use-control-props.ts:46 | Doccomment described fields composing `size ?? control?.size` at the call site — a code path that exists nowhere; size resolves purely through `useControlSize`/`useDensity`, and the context's `size` only seeds the `<Density>` scope. The phrasing invites adding the exact read the architecture avoids. | Rewrite to describe the real resolution path. | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 5 | DOC | CreditCardInput (+ Cvv) | credit-card-input.tsx:33 · credit-card-input-cvv.tsx:55 | "Emits the raw value" misdescribes `onValueChange` — it emits the formatted, spaced text (test-pinned), and in a masking component "raw" reads as the digit string it is not. Plus "defaults an 'Security code'" grammar. | "raw" → "formatted"; "an" → "a". | ✅ RESOLVED |

### Minor / watch-list

| Surface | Site | Note | Verb | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CurrencyInput | currency-input.tsx:84 | An external controlled-value change while `editingText` is non-null is shadowed until blur; date-input handles this with its `known`/`emitted` reconciliation (test-pinned). Real asymmetry with the sibling; may be an accepted simplification since currency has no calendar-like concurrent writer. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| CurrencyInput | currency-input.tsx:112 | `setNum` fires on every keystroke, so no-op edits (trailing `.`, digits past `precision`) re-emit the same value; the blur path guards (`parsed !== num`), onChange doesn't. | SIMPLIFY | ◯ OPEN |
| CreditCardInputCvv | credit-card-input-cvv.tsx:94-114 | The `mountedRef` mount-skip effect self-defeats under StrictMode's setup→cleanup→setup (one spurious dev-only `onValidityChange`); the repo's convention elsewhere is StrictMode-resilient prev-value refs. | SIMPLIFY | ◯ OPEN |
| CreditCardInput | credit-card-input.tsx:63 | Full `formatCardNumber` memo computed only to read `brand`; `detectCardBrand(masked.value)` is equivalent (card-validator strips separators) and skips the grouping work. | OPTIMIZE | ◯ OPEN |
| CreditCardInputCvv | credit-card-input-cvv.tsx:25 · utilities:104 | The Amex-4/others-3 CVV rule is encoded three times (`CVV_LENGTHS`, `validateCardCvv`, card-validator's `code.size`); consistent only while Amex stays the sole 4-CVV brand. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| Control | control.tsx:35 | `autoComplete` is a declared, cascaded, context-carried prop the component doc omits from its broadcast list. | DOC | ◯ OPEN |
| DateInput | date-input.tsx:152 | `activeMessage` (re-parses when text is complete) computes every render but is read only under `typedInvalid`; gate it. Negligible. | OPTIMIZE | ◯ OPEN |
| ContextMenu | menu-content.tsx:96 · use-floating-ui.ts:200 | Standalone `<ContextMenu>` restores no focus on Escape/selection close (`returnFocusTo` never attaches — no persistent trigger); grid implements its own restore, signalling host-responsibility by design. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| DatePicker / ColorPicker | date-picker-content.tsx:174 · color-picker-content.tsx:66 | Verbatim-duplicated focus-holding `motion.div` surface (motion + Density + Box). A shared `PopoverSurface` would absorb ~6 lines while both keep their own focus-manager scaffolding — worth it at a third consumer, not two. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| DatePicker (relative) | use-date-picker-relative-state.ts:362 | `chips`/`selectedIds` memos read `nowRef.current` without depending on it: a value committed before midnight on a long-mounted page can show a stale preset match until the next interaction. Consistent with the one-`now`-per-interaction design. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| useFormattedInput | use-formatted-input.ts:10 | Padding formatters (currency's `.` → `0.`, date's `1/` → `01/`) violate the `meaningful` "preserved across format" contract, forcing type-at-end caret branches at two call sites. When a third padding consumer appears, absorb an at-end option into the hook (`atEnd: 'jump' \| 'restore'`) — masks must keep `'restore'` (caret before trailing separators is what makes backspace work). | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |

### Audited clean (no findings)

dialog (open/close, focus trap/restore, dismiss ordering, scroll lock, ARIA —
all verified against the Overlay/panel primitives), date-input (the cap/carry
mask, parse validation incl. leap years and the sub-100-year `setFullYear` fix,
all three caret branches, the `known`/`emitted` reconciliation, commit guards),
control (the id/disabled/severity/readOnly/variant/size cascade verified
against its tests), copy-button (+ state hook), divider, dl (all three parts).
Batch-2's calendar lead is closed: `moveGridDate`/`moveGridMonths`/
`getInitialActiveDate` and the footer path all clamp into `[min, max]`, so the
DatePicker keyboard path cannot highlight or select a disabled date.

## Batch 4 — drawer · fieldset · file-upload · filters · flex · form · group · heading · hold-button · icon

### Executive summary

The two heavy subsystems are clean where it counts: form's `useSyncExternalStore`
snapshot is a stable ref (no render loop), and file-upload's drag depth-counter,
same-file input reset, and object-URL story (there are none to leak) all hold up.
The one real bug is small and self-inflicted by a helper: `FiltersClear` guarded
its child with `Children.only`, which throws on the bare-string child its own
doc promises to wrap in a default Button — so the documented fallback was
unreachable dead code and a string child crashed. Beyond that: one stale doc
(Field claiming an `invalid` inheritance that doesn't exist), one empty-`role=
alert` edge in Message, and a six-site `hasIssues` predicate begging to be one
helper. drawer, group, heading, icon, flex/stack/spacer/split, and hold-button
audited clean.

### Findings

| # | Verb | Surface | Site | Issue | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | FIX (high) | FiltersClear | filters-clear.tsx:24 | `const child = Children.only(children)` throws for any non-single-element child — including the bare string (`<FiltersClear>Clear</FiltersClear>`) the doccomment says "fall back to a default `<Button>`". `Children.only` also guarantees an element on return, so the `isValidElement(child)` check is always true and the entire Button fallback (41-45) is unreachable dead code; every test passes a single `<Button>`, so the promised path was never exercised. | Test `isValidElement(children)` directly (drop `Children.only`): a single element clones, anything else renders the default Button. New test pins the string fallback. | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 2 | DOC | Field | field.tsx:33 | The TSDoc lists `invalid` among the props Field inherits from an enclosing Control, but `ControlContextValue` has no `invalid` field — validation is carried solely by `severity` (Control's own doc correctly omits it). Stale doc on a public export invites a nonexistent read. | Drop `invalid` from the inherited list. | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 3 | FIX (low) | Message | message.tsx:109 | The `return null` guard covered only the form-bound path, so an unbound `error` Message with no children (the default `severity`) rendered a stray empty `<p role="alert">` — contradicting the doc's "(unbound) given children". | Guard on the existing `rendersError` flag: `severity === 'error' && !rendersError`, which covers both the form-bound-no-issues and unbound-no-children cases (warning/success still render their children). | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 4 | SIMPLIFY | form | form-reducer.ts:195 · use-form-reducer.ts:175,258 · use-form-{text,toggle,value}.ts | The "field is invalid" predicate `errors !== undefined && errors.length > 0` was inlined at six sites (two as `.some((issues) => …)` lambdas). | Extract `hasIssues(issues)` next to `normalizeIssues`; `.some(hasIssues)` at the reducer sites and `field && hasIssues(field.errors)` at the hooks — one definition of invalid. (The `field &&` guard stays: the hooks return `undefined` — not `false` — outside a Form, per §7.3.) | ✅ RESOLVED |

### Minor / watch-list

| Surface | Site | Note | Verb | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FileUpload | use-file-upload-handlers.ts:56 | `partitionFiles` filters only `maxSize`/`maxCount`; a drop doesn't re-enforce `accept`/`multiple` (the native input constrains only the OS picker). So a `multiple={false}` dropzone accepts N dropped files and `accept=".pdf"` accepts a dropped `.exe`. The `onReject` doc scopes rejection to size/count, so likely deliberate — confirm the boundary. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| FileUpload | use-file-upload-handlers.ts:110 | A pointer that leaves the window mid-drag without a final `dragleave`/`drop` leaves `dragDepth > 0` and the highlight stuck until the next enter. Inherent to the depth-counter pattern; no global `dragend` reset. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| Form | use-form-reducer.ts:275 | `onSettled` on success reports `valuesRef.current` (re-read after the async `onSubmit`), so a field edited mid-flight is reflected rather than the submitted snapshot. Likely intentional ("current values"). | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| Filters | filters.tsx:14 | `isActive(false) === true`, so toggling a Checkbox/Switch filter off keeps `{name: false}` in the payload and counts it — against the "drops empty fields" contract and inflating the count announcement. Likely deliberate (explicit-false filters). | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| Message | message.tsx:123 | The multi-error `<ul>` branch can't forward `{...props}` (the component types them as `<p>` attributes; spreading onto `<ul>` is a type error, so the single-error `<p>` branch and the `<ul>` diverge). Forwarding would need an unsafe cast; the real fix is a broader element typing, out of scope. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| HoldButton | hold-button.tsx:76 · use-hold-button-gesture.ts:110 | No `touch-action` (a finger-drift can let the browser claim the press as a scroll) and the completion timer closes over the reset-duration snapshot (a reduced-motion flip mid-press uses pre-flip timing). Both sub-frame/package-wide-uniform; `touch-action` appears nowhere in the package by choice. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |

### Audited clean (no findings)

drawer (panel family, mirrors the verified Dialog), group (+ `useGroup`
fragment-flattening position stamp), heading (+ its type-rung skeleton), icon,
and flex/stack/spacer/split (the literal responsive maps are deliberate for
Tailwind's scanner). hold-button verified against every failure mode — timer
cleanup, guard add/remove pairing, no double/missed completion, reduced-motion
parity, no pointer-capture mismanagement. form's core (snapshot stability,
resolution order, submit-race token guarding, zod-resolver cache) and
file-upload's core (drag counter, same-file reset, no object-URL leak) are
sound beyond the rows above.

## Batch 5 — input · json-tree · kanban · kbd · link · list · listbox · loading · markdown · mask-input

### Executive summary

The audit's most severe finding lands here, and it is a real cross-site
scripting hole: the Markdown renderer emitted `href`/`src` straight from
`marked`'s lexed tokens, so untrusted Markdown carrying a `javascript:`,
`data:text/html`, or `vbscript:` URL (including the tab-obfuscated
`java&#9;script:` form) produced a live link/image that ran script on click —
while the component's own doc billed raw-HTML stripping as the safety story. It
is fixed with a scheme allowlist (`safeUrl`), whitespace-normalized before the
scheme test, with two regression tests and a corrected security contract. Past
it, the batch is quiet: a memory-leak fix in the kanban drag-overlay map (a
mounted card's entry never got reclaimed), two concision tidies, and one
doccomment correction. The four leaves — kbd, link, loading (dots + spinner),
mask-input — audited clean. The two heavier subsystems, json-tree's virtualized
flatten/search machinery and the listbox select-state machine, are behaviorally
sound; what they surface (a bound-field `invalid` the select family discards,
roving that can't cross the virtualization window in one key) is recorded for a
family-level decision rather than reworked under a single component's sweep.

### Findings

| # | Verb | Surface | Site | Issue | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | FIX (high · XSS) | MarkdownRenderer | markdown-renderer.tsx:104,115 | `link`/`image` tokens rendered `href={token.href}` / `src={token.href}` verbatim from the lexer, so `[x](javascript:alert(1))` — or a `data:text/html`, `vbscript:`, or whitespace-obfuscated `java\tscript:` URL — emitted a live `href`/`src` that executes script on click. The renderer's doc names raw-HTML stripping as the safety guarantee (`Raw HTML tokens render nothing`) but never scheme-checked URLs, so a link/image was the open vector. Most severe finding of the audit. | Add a `safeUrl` scheme allowlist — `http`/`https`/`mailto`/`tel`, plus `data:` for images only — that strips ASCII whitespace before matching the scheme (defeating `java\tscript:`) and passes relative/root-relative/anchor/protocol-relative URLs through unchanged; an unsafe scheme resolves to `undefined` so no attribute renders. `href={safeUrl(token.href)}`, `src={safeUrl(token.href, true)}`. Two tests pin dangerous-scheme stripping and safe-URL / data-image passthrough; the `Markdown` security doccomment now states the guarantee. | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 2 | FIX (med) | KanbanCard | kanban-card.tsx:53-63 | The drag-overlay sync effect did `overlayMap.current.set(cardId, children)` on mount/update with no cleanup, so a card that unmounts (deleted, or the whole board torn down) left its entry in the shared `overlayMap` ref for the board's lifetime — an unbounded leak across a long-lived board that churns cards. | Effect returns `() => overlayMap.current.delete(cardId)`. Cleanup runs before setup within a flush, so a card moved across columns re-sets its own entry on remount and the overlay never sees a gap. | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 3 | SIMPLIFY | Input | input.tsx:93 | A dead `const resolvedInvalid = invalid ?? sharedAttrs.invalid` was computed and never read; the validation ternary independently recomputed the invalid resolution. | Drop the variable; inline `invalidAttrs(invalid)` in the `invalid === undefined ? sharedAttrs.validation : …` ternary — one expression of the resolution. | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 4 | SIMPLIFY | ListItem | list-item.tsx:107 | `{suffix && suffix}` — the `&&` short-circuit is a no-op (React renders `undefined`/`null`/`false` as nothing), so the guard only obscures that `suffix` renders itself. | `{suffix}`. | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 5 | DOC | flattenTree | json-tree-utilities.tsx:239-250 | The doccomment claimed a filtered match-free branch collapses to a `branch-open` row with `open=false`, but the flatten pass reads `open` straight from `expanded` and never forces a branch closed — that behavior belongs to the recursive renderer, not this path. Stale on `@internal` machinery invites a wrong mental model of the filter/virtualize divergence. | Restate the real divergence: filter mode omits non-matching leaves and keeps only match-path children, but a branch's open state still follows `expanded` (unlike the recursive renderer, which forces match-free branches closed). | ✅ RESOLVED |

### Minor / watch-list

| Surface | Site | Note | Verb | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Listbox | listbox.tsx:200,370 · use-listbox-state.ts:56 | `useFormValue` returns the bound field's `invalid`, but Listbox destructures only `value`/`setValue`/`setTouched` (200) and the trigger's `invalid` derives solely from `control?.severity` (370) — so a Form-bound Listbox with a field error but no `<Control severity>` shows no invalid chrome, unlike Input which routes the field's `invalid`. Select-family pattern (Combobox mirrors it); a family-level decision, not a per-component fix. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| Listbox | listbox.tsx:210 · use-listbox-state.ts:32,56 | `useListboxState` returns `close`, and `use-listbox-state.test.ts` exercises it, but the Listbox consumer never destructures it — `select` calls `close` internally within the hook. Tested-in-isolation surface, not dead; recorded so a reuse pass doesn't drop it (which breaks the hook test, as the batch-5 attempt confirmed). | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| VirtualOptions | virtual-options.tsx:170 | Empty-state gap first filed in batch 2 (the `containerRef` wrapper keeps the listbox non-`:empty`, so `peer-empty` "No results" never fires under virtualization). Still open; still a shared-primitive decision spanning Combobox + CommandPalette. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| Input | input-frame.tsx:60 | The prefix span carries `peer/prefix`, but no `peer-*/prefix` variant consumes it anywhere in the recipes or components, and the suffix span carries no matching marker — vestigial Tailwind peer metadata. Harmless; drop it or wire the intended `peer`-driven affix style. | SIMPLIFY | ◯ OPEN |
| JsonTree | json-tree.tsx:69,74-91 · json-tree-utilities.tsx:251 | Under `virtualize`, `useA11yRoving`'s `[role="treeitem"]` selector sees only the rendered viewport slice, so arrow-key roving can't step past the window edge in one press (the next item isn't in the DOM until scroll). Inherent to windowing + DOM-roving; recorded, not a one-line fix. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| JsonTree | json-tree.tsx:67 | `searchIndex` memoizes on `[data, searchValue]`, so a new `data` identity with unchanged content rebuilds the whole index. Correct (content-equality would cost more than the rebuild); noted so it isn't re-flagged. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| JsonTree | json-tree-utilities.tsx:336 | `PrimitiveValue` prints a string as `` `"${value}"` `` without escaping embedded `"`, `\`, or control chars, so a value containing a quote renders visually ambiguous (not valid JSON text). Display-only — the tree is a viewer, not a serializer — but a `JSON.stringify(value)` per scalar would render faithfully. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| KanbanCard | kanban-card.tsx:36-63 | An inert (read-only) card still calls `useKanbanContext()` and subscribes to the full board context; `memo` can't stop a re-render when any board-level field changes, even though the inert path reads none of the interactive handlers. Splitting a card-facing slice is the deeper fix; the memo already covers the common pointer-drag case. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| Kbd | kbd.tsx:21-23 | Modifiers render command-then-control (`⌘⌃`), the reverse of the platform ordering convention (Control before Command, `⌃…⌘`). Cosmetic and possibly deliberate; flag for the props-audit modifier pass. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| LoadingDots | loading-dots.tsx:37-39 | `k.dot({ size })` is re-evaluated once per dot inside the `.map`, though `size` is constant across the three; hoist to one `const dotClass` and `cn(dotClass, delay)`. Micro (three iterations). | OPTIMIZE | ◯ OPEN |
| List | list.tsx:139 | The reorderable `<ul>` keeps its implicit `role="list"`; keyboard-reorder semantics (lift/move/drop) are announced through dnd-kit's live region on the items rather than an ARIA composite-widget role on the container. Consistent with the semantic-list-plus-live-announcement design; recorded, not reworked. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| MarkdownRenderer | markdown-renderer.tsx:22-31 | `safeUrl(url, true)` intentionally allows `data:` on `<img src>` (inline images are a legitimate Markdown use); only script-capable schemes are blocked. The `data:text/html` link vector is closed because links pass `allowData = false`. Design boundary, recorded alongside the fix. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| MarkdownRenderer | markdown-renderer.tsx:25 | `safeUrl` whitespace-strips the whole URL to read a ~4-char scheme — O(payload) for a large `data:` image URI. A scheme-bounded match (`^\s*([a-z][a-z0-9+.\s-]*):`) would cap the work, but the leading `\s*` is mandatory: an anchored `^[a-z]` form silently readmits `" javascript:"` (browsers trim leading space before resolving the scheme), so the naive optimization is a security regression. Deferred — the win is uncommon-path and the current tested form is correct. | OPTIMIZE | ◯ OPEN |

### Audited clean (no findings)

kbd (pure server-renderable glyph leaf), link (defers to the `useLink`
component; `rel` auto-defaults for `target="_blank"`), loading-dots and
loading-spinner (static `<output>` live leaves with `sr-only` labels),
mask-input (+ `useMaskInput` — caret-preserving reformat through
`useFormattedInput`, Form binding through `useFormValue`, pre-formatted default
seeding). json-tree's path-encoding / search-index / flatten machinery and the
recursive-vs-virtualized renderers were traced beyond the rows above; the
listbox open/close/selection state machine, the deferred-toggle commit, and the
`readOnly` open-guard hold up. list's dnd-kit wiring (stable-key requirement,
memoized `<ul>` isolating the overlay from item re-renders, keyboard-lift
refocus) is sound.

## Batch 6 — menu · nav · number-input · odometer · pagination · password-confirm · password-input · password-strength · pdf-viewer · phone-input

### Executive summary

The batch's weight is in its three subsystems — the menu state machine, the
navigation family, and the 18-file pdf.js viewer — and that is where the nine
fixes cluster; the leaves (number-input, odometer, phone-input, password-input,
pagination) are correct and well-tested. The pdf-viewer async load lifecycle is
genuinely robust (every await boundary cancels its render task, destroys the
document, and revokes its blob URLs), but three subtler holes surfaced: a
document swap reused the previous document's per-page rotation for one paint
because the reset ran in an effect rather than in render (the page-size hook's
own precedent); a null `canvas.toBlob` was misclassified as teardown and
stranded `loading` at `true` forever; and the `PdfViewerContext` memo was
quietly defeated — two plain-arrow callbacks and a fresh `pageSize` literal gave
it a new identity every render, so its 18-entry dep array and its "identity
stays stable" comment were both dead. Menu contributed two robustness fixes: a
static inline menu still wired `onContextMenu` and so silently suppressed the
native right-click menu, and `MenuItem` spread consumer props *after* its
structural `role`/`tabIndex`/`type`, letting a caller drop a row out of roving.
Password-confirm had a real idref bug (a falsy-but-non-null `warning` dangled
the confirm field's `aria-describedby`), and password-strength shipped a public
props type referencing an un-exported `StrengthLevel` union. Two cleanups (a
dedup and a recipe-default/doc alignment) round it out. One real menu bug — a
static menu running the shared disclosure's Escape layer, so Escape reports a
false close and can swallow a Dialog's own dismiss — is recorded rather than
fixed: the clean fix needs a `dismissable` knob on the shared
`useFloatingDisclosure`, an architectural change to surface first.

### Findings

| # | Verb | Surface | Site | Issue | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | FIX (med) | usePdfViewerPageRotation | use-pdf-viewer-page-rotation.ts:32 | Per-page rotations were cleared in a post-paint `useEffect` keyed on the `pages` array identity, so a document swap rendered the new document's page N once with the *previous* document's `rotations[N]` before the effect cleared it — a one-frame stale-rotation flash. The sibling page-size hook resets in render specifically to avoid this class (test-pinned). | Move the reset to render-phase (`if (prev !== key) { prev = key; setRotations({}) }`), mirroring `usePdfViewerPageSize`; drop the now-unused `useEffect`. | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 2 | FIX (low) | usePdfViewerDocument | use-pdf-viewer-document.ts:110 | `if (!blob \|\| controller.cancelled) return 'cancelled'` conflated a failed rasterization with teardown: when `canvas.toBlob` yields `null` (oversized/tainted canvas, reachable at the ≤2 device-pixel scale on a large page) the caller ran `releasePdf` and returned without ever reaching `setLoading(false)`, so the viewport showed the loading placeholder forever with no error. | Split the checks: re-test `cancelled` (teardown) then `if (!blob) return 'ok'` — skip the page like the existing missing-2D-context branch and keep loading the rest. | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 3 | OPTIMIZE (med) | usePdfViewer (context memo) | use-pdf-viewer.ts:150 · use-pdf-viewer-pagination.ts:45 · use-pdf-viewer-page-size.ts:41,46 | The `PdfViewerContext` memo's "identity stays stable" guarantee was defeated: `goToPage` and `onImageLoad` were plain arrows (new identity every render), and `pageSize` was a fresh `{ width, height }` literal whenever the active page carried explicit dimensions — which also churned the `scale` memo that feeds the context. The 18-entry dep array and the stability comment were both inert. | `useCallback` `goToPage` (`[total, setCurrentPage]`) and `onImageLoad` (`[]`); `useMemo` `pageSize` on the primitive `width`/`height`. The memo now delivers its documented guarantee. | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 4 | FIX (low-med) | Menu (static) | menu.tsx:69 · use-menu-state.ts:93 | `onContextMenu` was wired whenever `!isDropdown`, which is also true for a static inline menu (`defaultOpen`, no `placement`). So right-clicking inside a static menu ran `handleContextMenu` → `preventDefault()`, silently killing the browser's native context menu for no benefit (the panel is already open; `setOpen(true)` is a no-op). | Compute `isContextMenu = !isDropdown && !isStatic` in `useMenuState` and gate the handler on it. | ◯ OPEN |
| 5 | FIX (low) | MenuItem | menu-item.tsx:88,118 | Both the link and button branches spread `{...rest}` *after* `role="menuitem"`, `tabIndex={-1}`, `data-slot`, and `type="button"`, so a consumer passing any of those wins — overriding `role` drops the item out of the `MENUITEM_SELECTOR` roving, `tabIndex`/`type` break the tab model or make it a form-submit. Asymmetric with the component's own `onClick`/`onKeyDown`, deliberately composed after the spread. | Move `role`/`tabIndex`/`data-slot`/`type` after `{...rest}`, matching the handler ordering and `MenuTrigger`. | ◯ OPEN |
| 6 | FIX (low) | PasswordConfirm | password-confirm.tsx:59 | `warningId` was assigned whenever `warning != null`, but the warning element renders only when `warning` is truthy — so a falsy-but-non-null `warning` (the `cond && 'text'` idiom with `cond` false) during a live mismatch pointed the confirm field's `aria-describedby` at an id no element carried (a WCAG idref violation). | Gate `warningId` on the same truthiness as the render: `warning ? generatedWarningId : undefined`. | ◯ OPEN |
| 7 | FIX + DOC (low) | password-strength | password-strength.tsx:15 · index.ts · use-password-strength.ts:12 | `StrengthLevel` is referenced by two exported public types (`PasswordStrengthProps.labels`, `PasswordStrengthChange.level`) but was not itself re-exported — the sibling `export type { PasswordRule, PasswordStrengthChange }` omitted it — so a consumer handling `onStrengthChange` couldn't name the `level` union, and declaration emit referenced an un-exported alias. | Add `StrengthLevel` to the component re-export and the barrel; give it a TSDoc (it had none). | ◯ OPEN |
| 8 | SIMPLIFY | password-confirm | password-confirm-utilities.ts:3 · use-password-confirm-state.ts:6 · context.ts:6 | `type LastEdited` was declared verbatim in two files and `Status` (`'idle' \| 'warning'`) was re-inlined at three sites. | Export both `@internal` from the utilities module (the folder's shared home per §3.5) and import them in the state hook and context. | ◯ OPEN |
| 9 | DOC | nav (bar recipe) | recipes/kata/nav.ts:82,93,122 | The `bar` recipe declared `defaults: { variant: 'outline' }`, but `NavBar` ships `variant = 'solid'` and always passes it explicitly — the recipe default was unreachable and contradicted the effective ship default (a latent trap if the component default were ever dropped). Both variant doccomments also mislabeled the set as `outline` \| `plain`, omitting the shipped `solid`. | Align the recipe default to `solid`; correct the docs to `solid` \| `outline` \| `plain`. | ◯ OPEN |

### Minor / watch-list

| Surface | Site | Note | Verb | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Menu (static) | use-floating-disclosure.ts:125 · menu-content.tsx:56 | A static menu initializes `open: true`, so `useFloatingDisclosure`'s `useEscapeLayer` is active and registers it in the shared dismiss-layer stack — pressing Escape calls `close()` → `onOpenChange(false)` while the panel (gated on `isStatic`, not `open`) stays visible, contradicting MenuContent's "static renders inline" doc, and a static menu inside a Dialog swallows the first Escape meant for the Dialog. The clean fix needs a `dismissable: false` knob on the shared disclosure hook (used by dialog/listbox/menu) — architectural, to surface before applying. | FIX | ◯ OPEN |
| MenuContent | menu-content.tsx:60,85 | `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby` are forwarded to `PopoverPanel` only in the static branch; the dropdown/context-menu branch drops them. A right-click context menu has no trigger to name it and equally can't be named. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| Menu | context.ts:66 | `useMenuContext` is exported with full TSDoc but has no production consumer (the barrel exports only `useMenuActions`; grep finds only its own test). Possibly dead, possibly deliberate advanced-composition surface — flagged tentatively, not treated as dead. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| Nav | nav-bar.tsx:15 · nav.tsx:21 | `NavBar` renders `<nav aria-label="Main">` and the value-binding `Nav` composition nests a second, unnamed `<nav>` inside it — two same-type landmarks, the inner unlabeled (discouraged by APG). The axe case and the demo's context tab both sidestep the nested path. Fix (emit a fragment from `Nav` inside a `NavBar`, or document `NavContext` for in-bar selection) is a design call. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| NavBar | nav-bar.tsx:22 | Opens an `ActiveIndicatorScope`, but the sole `ActiveIndicator` (`NavItem`, an `<li>`) always lives inside a `NavList`, which opens its own nearer scope — so `NavBar`'s scope resolves nothing in any valid composition (Pagination is the clean contrast: only its list opens a scope). Left as-is: the component doc explicitly claims it "establishes an active-indicator scope," so removing it is a doc-contradicting behavior change, not a pure cleanup. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| Nav | nav.test.tsx:186 · sidebar.test.tsx:378 | Test descriptions cite a `createNavItem` factory that doesn't exist (grep: only these two stale strings); `NavItem` renders the icon directly. Stale wording from a pre-`useNavItem` refactor. | DOC | ◯ OPEN |
| PdfViewer (viewport) | pdf-viewer-viewport.tsx:50 · use-pdf-viewer-document.ts:189 | `loading` is document-level and flips false only after the whole render loop, yet pages `setPages` as they rasterize — so the main viewport shows the placeholder until the last page finishes even though the thumbnail rail streams pages in. Progressive infra exists but the main view is all-or-nothing; confirm intent for large PDFs. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| usePdfViewerViewportSize | use-pdf-viewer-viewport-size.ts:36 | `measure` unconditionally `setSize({ width, height })` with a fresh literal, so an unchanged content box still re-renders (and recomputes scale/context). An `Object.is` guard on width/height would drop the redundant updates. | OPTIMIZE | ◯ OPEN |
| PdfViewer | pdf-viewer-toolbar.tsx:111 · pdf-viewer-viewport.tsx:46 | The toolbar's static page count and the viewport's `aria-live` "Page X of Y" announcer share `data-slot="pdf-viewer-page-status"`; `bySlot` returns the first, so tests pass, but the slot is ambiguous as a query/style anchor. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| PdfViewer (mobile) | pdf-viewer-toolbar.tsx:71 | The mobile thumbnail toggle carries `aria-expanded` and a fixed "Show thumbnails" label but only ever opens (`setThumbsOpen(true)`; the Sheet owns close) — the expanded+"Show"+no-collapse combination is mildly inconsistent for AT. Desktop a11y case doesn't exercise it. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| NumberInput | number-input.tsx:119 | The native `type="number"` has no `onWheel` guard, so a focused field increments/decrements on mouse-wheel scroll (the classic scroll-past-a-form footgun). Unoverridden native behavior; a `blur()`-on-wheel guard has its own downsides (interrupts wheel+keyboard users), so it's a genuine tradeoff, not an obvious fix. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| NumberInput | number-input.tsx:77 | From an empty field both Increase and Decrease seed to `clamp(0, min, max)` — decrease-from-empty lands on 0/min rather than `-step`. Deliberate and test-pinned for Increase (`'seeds the value to 0'`). | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |
| Odometer | odometer.tsx:55 | `aria-label={format(value)}` recomputes every animation frame during a tween though `value` is constant across it; `format` defaults to a cached `Intl.NumberFormat`, so the cost is negligible. | OPTIMIZE | ◯ OPEN |
| usePasswordStrength | use-password-strength.ts:108 | The effect dep array lists `passedCount`, which is exactly `passedIds.length` and only changes when `passedIds` identity changes — strictly redundant, harmless, arguably self-documenting. | WATCH | ◯ OPEN |

number-input (precision-derivation, clamp-after-round ordering, per-step
rounding, empty/NaN, controlled/uncontrolled/Form cascade, spinbutton a11y),
odometer (+ its rAF animated-value hook — mid-animation cancel, unmount cleanup,
reduced-motion snap, no hydration mismatch), phone-input (the NANP/international
formatters, the caret engine through `useMaskInput`/`useFormattedInput`, Form
binding), password-input (APG show/hide toggle, disabled mirroring, re-mask on
disable), and pagination (a consumer-driven compound family — no range algorithm

## Reliability appendix

Every row was traced to its definition and its consumption in source, then
cross-checked against the component's test file and grep before landing — the
Alert mount-announcement row was demoted from a suspected a11y gap to
"deliberate" precisely because `alert.test.tsx:142` pins it. Usage/consumption
claims are grep-verified (`DensityScope` reaches only `input-frame.tsx`;
`k.skeleton` shape confirmed against `kokkaku/avatar.ts` and `shaku.avatar`).
Findings marked SIMPLIFY change no behavior; the AvatarSkeleton conversion is
the one row touching a public export, and it preserves the `AvatarSkeletonProps`
surface (same `size` prop, same default) — its TSDoc and the `COMPONENTS.md`
row need no change.

Batch 2's two hardest calls were confirmed against the sibling precedents that
guard the same hazard — combobox's `clearVirtualActiveIndexed` on close (the
command-palette stale-index bug) and DatePicker's per-field `stopPropagation`
(the color-input focus bug) — and the Dialog→Overlay `PresencePortal` unmount was
verified to justify the ref-only palette fix. The four fixes ran the scoped suite
green (command-palette, combobox, and color, plus a new synchronous `equalHsva`
case). Per CONVENTIONS.md §10.3 the two floating/virtualized bugs carry no new
driven-lifecycle test; they rest on the
precedent guards and the passing existing suites. The cross-cutting VirtualOptions
row is recorded, not fixed: its resolution is a shared-primitive decision.

Batch 4's `hasIssues` dedup was the instructive one: the first pass used
`hasIssues(field?.errors)`, which collapsed the hooks' deliberate
`undefined`-outside-a-Form return (§7.3 — no opinion, defers to context) into
`false`. Three "outside a Form" tests caught it immediately; the landed form is
`field && hasIssues(field.errors)`, exactly equivalent to the original. The
Message `{...props}` inconsistency was left unfixed once the type checker showed
it's forced by the component's `<p>` typing, not an oversight. The FiltersClear
fix carries a new test that exercises the previously-dead string-fallback path.

Batch 5's headline is a genuine XSS vector, so it carries the batch's only new
security tests: one asserting a `javascript:`/`data:text/html` link and image
render no `href`/`src`, one asserting `http(s)`/`mailto` links and a `data:`
image URI survive — the allowlist has to fail closed without breaking inline
images. The whitespace strip in `safeUrl` is load-bearing, not cosmetic:
browsers drop ASCII tab/newline when resolving a scheme, so `java&#9;script:`
resolves to `javascript:` at click time; the regex `noControlCharactersInRegex`
lint forced the `\s`-class form over a literal `[ - ]` range. The
kanban leak fix was verified against the cross-column move it must not regress —
cleanup-before-setup means a remounting card re-populates `overlayMap` in the
same flush, so the drag overlay never reads an empty slot. The listbox `close`
row is recorded rather than removed precisely because the batch-5 reuse attempt
dropped it and `use-listbox-state.test.ts` went red on three assertions: the
returned surface is the hook's tested contract, not the component's dead code.
Types and the scoped Vitest suite (1498 tests across 72 files) ran green after
the revert. The four-angle simplify pass (reuse, simplification, efficiency,
altitude) found the batch already clean: `safeUrl` duplicates no existing helper
and sits at the correct module-private altitude (Markdown is the only component
parsing URLs from untrusted input), and its lone efficiency note — the
full-URL whitespace strip — was deferred rather than applied because the obvious
scheme-bounded rewrite drops the leading-whitespace defense and readmits
`" javascript:"`; the naive optimization is a security regression, so it is
recorded as an OPEN optimize row instead.

Batch 6 was the widest sweep — three real subsystems (menu, nav, the 18-file
pdf.js viewer) plus five leaves — run as five parallel per-unit audit agents,
every candidate then re-verified against source and tests before landing. Two
verifications reshaped the plan. The pdf-viewer context-memo finding was
confirmed by reading all three churn sources (the two plain-arrow callbacks and
the `pageSize` literal); its fix honors the documented "stable identity" intent
rather than deleting the memo, because the codebase clearly means the context to
be stable — nothing downstream is memoized yet, but the design says it should
be. The rotation-flash fix copies the page-size hook's own render-phase reset
verbatim, so it rests on an already-test-pinned precedent. The menu static-Escape
bug is the batch's deliberate non-fix: it is real (a static menu inside a Dialog
swallows the Dialog's Escape), but the clean fix is a `dismissable` knob on the
shared `useFloatingDisclosure` — used by dialog, listbox, and menu — so per
§3.1 it is surfaced as a FIX-verb watch row rather than applied under a single
batch. The nav `ActiveIndicatorScope` removal was likewise declined: the scope
is dead in every shipped composition, but the component doc explicitly claims
it, so dropping it is a doc-contradicting behavior change, not a cleanup. Types
and the scoped Vitest suite (1210 tests across 71 files, including all menu,
pdf-viewer, and password-confirm suites) ran green after the nine fixes.
