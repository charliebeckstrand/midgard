## Principles

- Simplicity above all. The best solution is the simplest one that fully solves the problem. Speculative abstractions age poorly — earn complexity through proven need.
- Hold yourself to a staff engineer standard. Only propose changes you would confidently ship to production. Challenge your own work before presenting it.
- If a solution feels wrong, iterate until it doesn't. Demand excellence.

## Code

- Understand before modifying. Read the surrounding code, follow its conventions, and let consistency guide your decisions.
- Build from small, composable pieces. Colocate what belongs together. Let the type system carry its weight — if a type is hard to express, rethink the design.
- Formatting is tooling's job. Never fight the formatter.
- Solve the stated problem — not adjacent ones. A bug fix is not a refactoring opportunity. If the right fix requires broadening scope, ask first.

## Architecture

- Extend before inventing. Prefer growing an existing module over creating a new one unless there is a clear, distinct boundary.
- Dependencies flow inward. Shared packages never depend on application code.
- Abstractions are extracted, not predicted. Duplication across multiple call sites earns a shared utility; a single use case does not.
- When an existing component almost fits but is missing a capability (e.g. ref forwarding, a variant, a prop), ask the user whether extending the component makes sense long-term — not just for the immediate use case. Never update a shared component without explicit approval; propose the change and let the user decide.

## Git

- Imperative mood, atomic commits. Each commit represents one logical change, described by what it does — not what you did.
- Feature branches for non-trivial work. Never force-push shared branches.
- Review your own diff before committing. Read it as a reviewer would.

## Workflow

For non-trivial work (three or more steps), enter planning mode before writing code. Delegate research to subagents — one focused task per agent — and keep the main context window clean. Summarize at milestones, not line by line.

## Skills

- When asked to create, add, build, or scaffold a new UI component in `packages/ui`, always use the `/ui-component` skill. This ensures the component follows established patterns, uses the recipe system correctly, and integrates with existing primitives.
- When asked to recommend, suggest, or identify new UI components — or asked what's missing, what to build next, or how to expand the library — always use the `/ui-component-recommend` skill. After recommendations are approved, use `/ui-component` to create each one.
- After writing or modifying TypeScript code, use the `/code-quality` skill to verify formatting, lint compliance, and idiomatic patterns. This catches non-null assertions, `any` types, enums, `React.FC`, and other disallowed patterns that automated tooling may miss.
